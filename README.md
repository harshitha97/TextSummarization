As a part of learning of RNN:

• I Developed a RNN deep learning model using GRU and LSTM for abstractive text summarization on CNN Daily News and Amazon Fine
Food Reviews datasets while optimizing model hyperparameters using grid and random search techniques.
• Demonstrated expertise through rigorous performance evaluations using metrics like ROUGE, F1 score, recall, and precision, alongside
human assessments. Achieved an impressive 75% training and validation accuracy, with GRU consistently outperforming for both datasets.
